### File Descriptions
#### Main File
1. ```Main.py``` All the functions are here, Run this file in ternminal.
2. ```CreatingDatabase.py``` Create database with preset tables.
3. ```AddingData.py``` Input the preset data to the database.
4. ```system.db``` The database file created from ```CreatingDatabase.py```, delete before you create a new database.

#### Not Crucial File
5. ```DbFunction.py``` We use to test our Python+SQLite functions


## Project Plan  

**Languages we use:** Python, SQLite

**Tools we use:** 
  1. SQLite3 from python (database)
  2. Tkinter from python (GUI)
  3. DBeaver (to test our quary)
  4. Visual Studio Code, PyCharm
  5. Github (for version control and collaboration)

We use Python and SQLite to create the database and functions,
then we use Tkinter to create the User Interface so that we can interact with the databse by clicking the buttons in GUI.

We use SQLite because it is serverless, convenient to use without install or setup anything, and also easy to build quary than others.

We also use Github for idea exchange and code collaboration, and most importantly, we use it for version control during development.
